    ## What is YouTube Downloader Pro?

    YouTube Downloader Pro is a free and open-source tool designed to help users download YouTube videos in high quality without the typical limitations of low resolution and device restrictions.

    ## Purpose

    The purpose of creating this tool was personal. When I wanted to download YouTube videos for my studies, I was limited to 480p low-quality downloads and could watch them only on a single device. Sharing the videos or watching on other devices was not possible. Furthermore, on PCs, sometimes downloaded videos get lost unexpectedly.

    To solve these problems, I created this tool and now distribute it freely to those who:
    - Cannot afford YouTube Premium,
    - Live in remote areas with unstable network connections.

    ## Key Features

    - High-quality video and audio downloads.
    - Ability to share downloads across multiple devices.
    - No data collection.
    - No targeted third-party advertisements.
    - Fully free and open to use.
    - Non-profit; developed purely to serve community needs.
